# Modelarium

## Origins

The project is a fork of the excellent Open WebUI, based on v0.6.5 (before the move to a new license). I understand and respect their reasoning for the license change, but I wanted the freedom to take my fork in any direction both now and in the future, so I've frozen the upstream code at the v0.6.5 level and won't be pulling in later changes. I want to thank Timothy Jaeryang Baek and all the contributors to the Open WebUI project for building such a great foundation for exploration. This project wouldn't exist without their hard work!

This is the branch where I through all caution to the wind and just turn OWUI into my ideal environment for working with models. In practice, that means turning Open WebUI back into an Ollama WebUI (though not in name, of course). I'm all in on Ollama, so this branch will be too. Lots more focus on model management and reorienting what exists back to an Ollama base, and away from OWUI's internal model representations.
